# Hebbian CNN Demo

This repository aims at providing a quick demo code for Hebbian learning 
experiments with CNNs.

Usage:  
`python demo.py --device <device>`  
where `<device>` can be `cpu`, `cuda:0`, etc.

This script creates a simple Hebbian CNN and launches a training session
using the [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset.

If you have questions, or you are interested to work on this topic and 
would like to know more about possible work directions, you are welcome
