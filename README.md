# Hebbian CNN Demo

This repository aims at providing a quick demo code for Hebbian learning 
experiments with CNNs.

Usage:  
`python demo.py --device <device>`  
where `<device>` can be `cpu`, `cuda:0`, etc.

This script creates a simple Hebbian CNN and launches a training session
using the [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset.
